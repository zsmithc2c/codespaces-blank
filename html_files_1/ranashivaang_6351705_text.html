  <p># thought process: # reverse the input and check if the reversed input is the same as the original input # if it is the same then it is a palindrome # if it is not the same then it isn't a palindrome # for empty strings it should return True # for strings with spaces and punctation, i will assume that they should be left alone and not removed as it could change the meaning of the word def palindrome_checker(s1): # store reversed string reverseds1 = "" # go through original string and reverse it for letter in s1: reverseds1 = letter + reverseds1 # check if original is equal to reversed if s1 == reverseds1: print("The string is a palindrome") # conditional if it is NOT equal to each other else: print("The string is not a palindrome") palindrome_checker("racecar")</p>
