<h1>December Submission: Problem 2: Benjamin DeGraff</h1>
<div style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;">
  <p>#Create a program that says: "I can calculate the area of a shape for you. Which shape do you want me to calculate the area of?" and then asks the user to type in the name of a shape (e.g., triangle, rectangle, square, circle).<br>#Then, depending on which shape the user types, the program will ask for the relevant measurements:<br>#If they choose circle, prompt for the radius.<br>#If they choose rectangle, prompt for the length and width.<br>#If they choose square, prompt for the side length.<br>#If they choose triangle, prompt for the base and height.<br>#Use the correct formula to calculate and return the area of the chosen shape.</p>
<p>#User input needed to get answers from user<br>#Based on answers, calculate the area using the chosen formula<br>#Input: string/int<br>#Output: int</p>
<p>PI = 3.14159 #Constant for PI</p>
