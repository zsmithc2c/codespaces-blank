<h1>December Submission: Problem 2: Sebastian Escobar Jaimes</h1>
<div style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;">
  <p>I really don't know how I would solve this problem but what I think I would do in simple terms is I will use something to import something like math then I will my introduction and an input statement saying to put the shape then after them putting the shape it would put the shapes info like their size or radius to calculate their area and after I put the import it will do the math and in the output will show the area with a message to end the program or put another shape.</p>
