<h1>December Submission: Problem 2: Hector	Perez Ramirez</h1>
<div style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;">
  <p># based on my understanding of the problem i need to ask the user for a type of shape and then ask for the right measurments to calculate the area of the shape.</p>
<p># plan:<br># 1. ask the user for the type of shape<br># 2. determine right calculation based on shape<br># 3. ask for the right measurments and print the output. (the output should be area)</p>
<p>#-------------------------------</p>

<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; elif shape.lower() == "square":<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; # For square, we need the side length<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; side = float(input("Please enter the side length of the square: "))<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; area = side * side &nbsp;# Formula for the area of a square<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; print(f"The area of the square is: {area:.2f}")</p>

Which shape do you want me to calculate the area of?")<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; shape = input("Please enter the name of the shape (e.g., circle, rectangle, square, triangle): ").strip()</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; # Call the function to calculate the area based on the user input<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; calculate_area(shape)</p>
<p># Run the program<br>if __name__ == "__main__":<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; main()</p>
