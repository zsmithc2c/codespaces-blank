<h1>December Submission: Problem 2: Ryan</h1>
<div style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;">
  <p>#create a function that can calculate the area of certain shapes&nbsp;<br>#input: shape, length, width, radius<br>#output: area of shape</p>
<p>#return area of shape<br>#area = length*width, (length*width)/2, or 3.14*radius*radius</p>
<p>#make a def for circle that takes in radius and finds area<br>def circle():<br>&nbsp; radius = input("what is the radius?")<br>&nbsp; area = int(radius)*int(radius)*3.14<br>&nbsp; print(f"the area of the circle is {area}")</p>
