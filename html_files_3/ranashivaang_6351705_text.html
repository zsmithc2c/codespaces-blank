  <p># thought process: # make a empty list that stores everything "we" have seen # go through each letter # check if the letter we are on is in the seen list we originally made # if the letter we are on is the seen list that means theres duplicates # if it isnt seen, we add it to the list because its a unique letter # if the loop successfully runs in its entirety then we return True # if the loop stops at any point then it returns False since that means there was a duplicate def has_unique_characters(s1): seenLetters = [] for letter in s1: if letter in seenLetters: return False seenLetters.append(letter) return True</p>
