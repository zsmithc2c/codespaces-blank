  <p># TLDR: replace() to remove spaces<br># okay the directions point out that I should consider cases where the string<br># has spaces which makes me think that spaces shouldn't be considered when<br># checking to make sure every character is unique, so I probably have to<br># figure out how to remove all spaces before checking<br># lol. this already exists in python. Thank you replace(oldvalue, newvalue) :)</p>
<p># TLDR: empty string = False<br># I mean, by deafult the code is *probably* going to detrimine that an empty<br># string is in-fact a string that has all unique characters, and while I<br># personally agree since no characters can be doubled in an empty string, I think<br># I'm gonna make a special case where if the string is empty it just tells you<br># that you submitted an empty string. (if statement for brownie points lets goo.)</p>
<p># TLDR: Double for loop to solve duplicates&nbsp;<br># okay it sounds like I need to compare every character with<br># every other character in the string and if any two characters match,&nbsp;<br># condition is false since not all characters are unique.<br># ....soooo, double for loop? *yawn emoji*</p>
<p># Ngl sounds like I could do this in a single function :/</p>
<p>def check_unique_characters(user_str):<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; a_str = user_str.replace(" ", "") # set func var to user input w/o spaces<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; # Quick check for empty strings.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; if (a_str == ""):<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; print("Invalid input: Empty string (Or string with only spaces). Please try again.")<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; return False<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; # Aaaand finally, combing through string for any dulpicate characters<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; for i in range (0, len(a_str)-1, 1): # range(start, stop, step)<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; for j in range (i+1, len(a_str), 1): # range(start, stop, step)<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; if (a_str[i] == a_str[j]):<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; return False # Found repeating character<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; return True # did not find repeating character</p>
<p><br>u_input = str(input("Please input a string: "))<br># strings are fun because i can just cast to string and no matter what<br># the user actually input, it will come out as a valid input for string functions</p>
