  <p># Number Guessing Game Program</p>
<p># Step 1: Understand the problem<br># The program generates a random number between 1 and 100 and allows the user to guess until they find the correct number.</p>
<p># Step 2: Create a plan<br># 1. Generate a random number between 1 and 100.<br># 2. Prompt the user to guess the number.<br># 3. Check if the guess is correct, too high, or too low.<br># 4. Provide feedback and allow the user to guess again.<br># 5. Handle invalid inputs gracefully.</p>
