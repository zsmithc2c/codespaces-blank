  <p>#Create a program that plays a guessing game with the user. The program will choose a random number between 1 and 100, and then ask the user to guess the number.<br>#If the user guesses correctly, the program congratulates the player and ends the game.<br>#If the user's guess is too high, the program tells them the answer is smaller and lets them guess again.<br>#If the user's guess is too low, the program tells them the answer is larger and lets them guess again.</p>
<p>#Generate a random number, then use a while loop to continue playing until user guesses the number</p>
