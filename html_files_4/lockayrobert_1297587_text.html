  <p># U:<br># - problem: guide the user through a binary search<br># - validate input: needs to be a number that is within 1 and 100<br># - inputs: guess (number) output: too high, too low, or bingo</p>
<p># C:<br># - need to generate random num<br># - some sort of loop that runs while the user hasnt guessed num yet</p>
