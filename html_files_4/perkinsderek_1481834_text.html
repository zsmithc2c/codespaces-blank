  <p>'''</p>
<p>Create a program that plays a guessing game with the user. The program will choose a random number between 1 and 100, and then ask the user to guess the number.</p>
<p>If the user guesses correctly, the program congratulates the player and ends the game.<br>If the user's guess is too high, the program tells them the answer is smaller and lets them guess again.<br>If the user's guess is too low, the program tells them the answer is larger and lets them guess again</p>
