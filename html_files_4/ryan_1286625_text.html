<div style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;">
  <p>#create a guessing game for the user to guess a number between 1 to 100<br>#input: user number guess<br>#output: lower, higher, you got it!</p>

<p>#import random so the function can pick a random number<br>import random</p>
<p>#create a function that will generate a random number<br>numbers = list(range(1,101))<br>#use random.choice to pick a random number&nbsp;<br>picked_number = random.choice(numbers)</p>
<p>def guess(picked_number):<br>&nbsp; #make the user pick a number&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; user_guess = int(input("guess a number from 1-100:"))<br>&nbsp; #compare the numbers and if the user guess is too high, tell the user to guess lower<br>&nbsp; if user_guess &gt; picked_number:<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; print("too high, guess lower")<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; guess(picked_number)<br>&nbsp; #compare the numbers and if the user guess is too low, tell the user to guess higher<br>&nbsp; elif user_guess &lt; picked_number:<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; print("too low, guess higher")<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; guess(picked_number)<br>&nbsp; #compare the numbers and if the user guess is correct, tell the user they got it<br>&nbsp; elif user_guess == picked_number:<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; print("congrats, you got it!")<br>&nbsp; else:<br>&nbsp; #if the input is invalid, tell the user to input a valid number and try again<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; print("invalid input, try again")<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; guess(picked_number)</p>
