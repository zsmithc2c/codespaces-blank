<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; // Step 2: Clues<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; // To generate a random number, we need to use the Random class.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; // We need to ask the user for their guess using Scanner.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; // We need to compare the user's guess to the randomly chosen number.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; // Randomly pick a number between 1 and 100<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Random random = new Random();<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; int targetNumber = random.nextInt(100); &nbsp;// Error: Random number between 0 and 99, we need 1 to 100<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; int guess = -1; // Initialize guess to an invalid number<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; int attempts = 0; // To keep track of how many guesses the user has made<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; // Step 3: Assemble the game loop<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; System.out.println("Welcome to the Guessing Game!");<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; System.out.println("I have chosen a number between 1 and 100.
