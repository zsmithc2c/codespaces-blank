  <p># create program that asks user for number and keeps asking them while<br># they have not guess it. also rpvoide hints by telling them if if<br># there guess is to low or to high<br># will need to use random<br>import random</p>
<p># need to get random number<br>randomNum = random.randint(1,100)</p>
<p># need to use input to get input<br>guess = int(input("guess a number between 1 and 100 "))</p>
<p># need to use while loop to keep asking user for input<br>while guess != randomNum:<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;# if num greater than randomNum tell user &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; if(guess &gt; randomNum):<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; print("num to high")<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; # if num less than randomNum tell user &nbsp; &nbsp;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; elif(guess &lt; randomNum):<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; print("num to low")<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; else:<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; print("you got it")<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; break<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; # ask user again to enter a guess<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; guess = int(input("guess a number between 1 and 100 "))</p>
