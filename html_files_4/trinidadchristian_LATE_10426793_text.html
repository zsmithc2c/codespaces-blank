  <p>import random<br>#function to make the guessing game starts by setting the random number. Then sets a variable guess to 0 to represent the users guess of the number then we have a&nbsp;<br>#message that lets the user know to guess a number between 1 and 100. Then we have a while loop that will keep running until the user gets the correct answer. If the user inputs a guess not between 1 and 100, the program will tell the user to guess between 1 and 100. If the user guesses the correct answer it prints a congratulations message and tells the user how many guesses it took. If the user guesses too high, the program will tell the user the guess is too high and if the user guesses too low, the program will tell the user the guess is too low.<br>def number_guessing_game():</p>
