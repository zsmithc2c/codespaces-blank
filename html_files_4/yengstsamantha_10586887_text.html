<p># I need a system to process user input.<br># user is only allowed to input int values, so throw error when it's not a int<br># input. (I think I had to solve the problem of getting good int inputs from<br># another problem (problem 2) so I might be able to reuse some of that code here)</p>
<p># it wants a random number between 1 and 100 so I can use the random class to<br># give me a random int :'D</p>
